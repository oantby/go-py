# go.py: My python shortlink manager

This is a preliminary shortlink engine, which enables
authenticated users to create and renew shortlinks,
and enables all users to *use* shortlinks.

This program is likely to end up with several sibling
repositories of lower level, moving from python w/flask
to pure python to C++ cgi to C++ server, maybe getting
to a point of pure C server, if I get bored enough
